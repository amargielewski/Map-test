# Map Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The large `Map.tsx` file (831 lines) has been successfully refactored into smaller, more maintainable components and hooks. This improves code organization, reusability, and follows React best practices.

## File Structure

### Constants
- **`src/constants/mapConstants.ts`**
  - Contains all map-related constants: `TEST_CONFIG`, `INITIAL_VIEW_STATE`, `MAP_STYLES`
  - Exports type definitions and utility functions for map styles
  - Centralizes configuration for easy maintenance

### Components
- **`src/components/DebugToolbar.tsx`**
  - Standalone component for debug information display
  - Shows performance metrics, viewport bounds, and map information
  - Receives all necessary props from parent component

- **`src/components/PerformanceTestControls.tsx`**
  - Handles performance test configuration UI
  - Includes controls for dot count, speed, trails, and viewport culling
  - Communicates with performance test store

### Custom Hooks
- **`src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts`**
  - Encapsulates FPS and frame time calculation logic
  - Returns performance metrics for use in components
  - Handles animation frame monitoring

- **`src/hooks/useViewportCulling.ts`**
  - Manages viewport culling calculations
  - Handles Web Mercator projection math
  - Updates viewport bounds based on map view changes

- **`src/hooks/usePerformanceTestLayers.ts`**
  - Creates and manages deck.gl layers for performance testing
  - Handles both high-performance and legacy modes
  - Optimizes layer creation and updates

### Main Component
- **`src/app/Map.tsx`** (Simplified from 831 to ~90 lines)
  - Now focuses only on core map functionality
  - Orchestrates other components and hooks
  - Cleaner, more readable code structure

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each file has a single, well-defined responsibility
- UI components are separated from business logic
- Constants are centralized for easy configuration

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other parts of the application
- Hooks can be shared across multiple components
- Easier to test individual pieces

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Clear file organization makes finding code intuitive
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 4. **Performance**
- Custom hooks optimize re-renders
- Layer creation logic is memoized efficiently
- Performance monitoring is isolated and optimized

### 5. **Type Safety**
- Better TypeScript support with focused interfaces
- Clearer prop types for each component
- Reduced complexity in type definitions

## File Size Reduction
- **Original:** 831 lines in single file
- **Refactored:** 
  - Main component: ~90 lines
  - Supporting files: ~100-200 lines each
  - Total: Better organized across multiple focused files

## Usage
The refactored code maintains the same external API. The `MapComponent` can be imported and used exactly as before, but now benefits from improved internal organization and maintainability.

```tsx
import { MapComponent } from './Map';

// Usage remains the same
<MapComponent />
```

This refactoring follows React best practices and makes the codebase more scalable for future development.
